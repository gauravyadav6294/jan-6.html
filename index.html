            <h3>NINJA H2:The racking rocket</h3>

        </div>
        <div id="data">
            <p> The street-legal Ninja H2 has rear-view mirrors in place of the track-only H2R's wings.[13] It also has
                plastic body panels in place of the H2R's carbon fiber. The street-legal bike is said to make 200
                horsepower (150 kW), probably with reduced supercharger boost compared to the H2R.[13] The H2 and H2R
                share the supercharger (with a lower boost level on the H2) and many other components, with the
                exception of head gasket, cam profile and timing with ECU mapping, and exhaust system as well as the R's
                clutch has two additional plates.[1] Cycle World recorded a
                1
                /
                4
                mile time of 9.62 sec. @ 152.01 mph (244.64 km/h) with a 0 to 60 mph acceleration at 2.6 seconds and a
                top speed of 183 mph (295 km/h).[34] Kent Kunitsugu, editor for Sport Rider magazine, competing in a
                land-speed racing event in Mojave, California at the Mojave Air and Space Port airfield in the Mojave
                Magnum land-speed racing, took a Ninja H2 with just a few bolt-on performance parts adding over 70
                horsepower and achieved a top speed of 226.9 mph (365.2 km/h)</p>
